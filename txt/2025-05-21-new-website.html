    I have decided to make a new website for myself.
    I used to have a blog that was generated with hugo (and had a whooping 2 posts, both now moved here),
    but I don't like markdown and am becoming less and less of a fan of anything that requires a build step.
  <p>
    So I am now writing a website directly in html.
    It is currently very plain, but I plan on adding fancy css and some progressive-enhancement javascript.
  <p>
    In particular, my wishlist includes:
  <ol>
    <li> Syntax highlighting
    <li> "Copy" button for code blocks
    <li> a way to render equations, preferably using typst
  </ol>
